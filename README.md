Lab 7:
This script is a simple script that allows you to BLUR, EMBOSS, or SHARPEN an image.
To use this script you want to begin by installing PILLOW for Python.
In your python terminal in VSCODE type in the following commands:
```PowerShell
python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m ensurepip --default-pip
```
To see if pip is installed type
```Check pip
python -m pip
```
Now that we have Pillow installed head over to my Lab7 folder and git pull the folder.
Once you have the folder in your visual studio code in your powershell terminal.
```CD
cd Lab7
```
Now you are working inside the folder with the script. From here you can drag and drop images directly into the Lab7 folder.
Now you are ready to run the script.
```Run
python PillowTesting.py
```
From here the script will ask you what image you would like to select and if you would like to BLUR, EMBOSS, or SHARPEN.
